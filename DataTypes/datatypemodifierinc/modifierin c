1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 

Integer
Character
Boolean
Floating Point
Double Floating Point
Valueless or Void
Wide Character
2. Derived Data Types: The data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 

Function
Array
Pointer
Reference
3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: These data types are defined by the user itself. Like, as defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes: 

Class
Structure
Union
Enumeration
Typedef defined Datatype
This article discusses primitive data types available in C++. 

Integer: The keyword used for integer data types is int. Integers typically require 4 bytes of memory space and range from -2147483648 to 2147483647.  
Character: Character data type is used for storing characters. The keyword used for the character data type is char. Characters typically require 1 byte of memory space and range from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255.  
Boolean: Boolean data type is used for storing Boolean or logical values. A Boolean variable can store either true or false. The keyword used for the Boolean data type is bool. 
Floating Point: Floating Point data type is used for storing single-precision floating-point values or decimal values. The keyword used for the floating-point data type is float. Float variables typically require 4 bytes of memory space. 
Double Floating Point: Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double-precision floating-point values or decimal values. The keyword used for the double floating-point data type is double. Double variables typically require 8 bytes of memory space. 
void: Void means without any value. void data type represents a valueless entity. A void data type is used for those function which does not return a value. 
Wide Character: Wide character data type is also a character data type but this data type has a size greater than the normal 8-bit datatype. Represented by wchar_t. It is generally 2 or 4 bytes long.
The size of variables might be different from those shown in the above table, depending on the compiler
and the computer you are using.

sizeof operator — sizeof operator is used to find the number of bytes occupied by a variable/data type in computer memory. Eg:     int m , x[50];     cout<<sizeof(m); //returns 4 which is the number of bytes occupied by the integer variable “m”.     cout<<sizeof(x); //returns 200 which is the number of bytes occupied by the integer array variable “x”.     


// Following is the example, which will produce correct size of various data types on your computer.
  
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
  
int main() 
{
    cout << "Size of char : " << sizeof(char) << endl;
    cout << "Size of int : " << sizeof(int) << endl;
      
    cout << "Size of long : " << sizeof(long) << endl;
    cout << "Size of float : " << sizeof(float) << endl;
      
    cout << "Size of double : " << sizeof(double) << endl;
      
      return 0;
}
Output
Size of char : 1
Size of int : 4
Size of long : 8
Size of float : 4
Size of double : 8


Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Datatype Modifiers
As the name suggests, datatype modifiers are used with the built-in data types to modify the length of data that a particular data type can hold. 

Modifiers in C/C++

Data type modifiers available in C++ are: 

Signed
Unsigned
Short
Long
The below table summarizes the modified size and range of built-in datatypes when combined with the type modifiers:
